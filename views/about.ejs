        <h1>About FailStory</h1>

        <p>
          Welcome to <strong>FailStory</strong> — a space where honesty meets inspiration.
          This platform is owned and founded by <strong>Sarthak Jain</strong>, an
          entrepreneur and creative thinker passionate about building meaningful digital
          communities. I’m <strong>Krish Jain</strong>, a student at
          <strong>IIT BHU</strong> and the lead web developer behind the project, working
          closely with Sarthak to bring this vision to life. Together, we built FailStory
          with a simple mission — to change the way people look at failure. <br /><br />
          FailStory was born from the belief that every setback is a lesson waiting to be
          shared. Instead of hiding our mistakes, we wanted to create a platform where
          people can talk about them openly, learn from one another, and grow stronger as
          a community. Every story published here is reviewed and curated by
          <strong>Sarthak Jain</strong>, ensuring that FailStory remains a genuine,
          high-quality space for real human experiences. <br /><br />
          Our goal is to redefine failure as a stepping stone toward growth — whether
          you’re a student, a startup founder, or someone finding your path. Through open
          storytelling, personal reflection, and shared learning, FailStory aims to
          inspire resilience, self-belief, and the courage to keep moving forward.
          <br /><br />
          Built with modern web technologies and designed for simplicity, FailStory
          represents more than just a website — it’s a startup driven by authenticity,
          collaboration, and heart. We believe that failure is not the opposite of
          success but its foundation, and every shared story brings us one step closer to
          understanding that truth.
